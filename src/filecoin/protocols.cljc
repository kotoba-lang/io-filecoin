  "The seams. Everything impure this library needs is one of these, supplied
  by the host — the same contract `storj.protocols` and `kotoba.lang.ipfs`
  keep, and the reason the rest of the code runs unchanged on a JVM, in a
  Cloudflare Worker, under nbb, or behind a WASM capability import.

  `ISigner` is deliberately not a key type. This library never sees a
  private key: it produces the bytes to be signed and takes back a
  signature, so a host can hold the key in a Keychain, a KMS, a hardware
  wallet or a browser extension without this code changing or knowing.")

  "A single request. `req` is
  `{:method :post :url \"…\" :headers {…} :body \"…\"}`; the return is
  `{:status Int :body String}` on :clj and a Promise of the same on :cljs."
  (request [this req]))

(defprotocol ISigner
  "Sign `digest` (a vector of 0..255 ints) as `address`.

  What `digest` is depends on the signature type and the caller has already
  decided it: `filecoin.message/digest-for-secp256k1` for ECDSA, or the raw
  `signing-bytes` for BLS. Returns `{:type n :data [ints…]}`."

(defprotocol IVerifier
  "Verify `signature` over `digest` for `address`. Returns a boolean.

  Filecoin needs two curves — secp256k1 for `f1` and BLS12-381 for `f3` —
  and this library implements neither. secp256k1 is available in this
  workspace (`kotoba-lang/eth-crypto`); BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly
  curve and is not, which is why this is a seam rather than a function."
