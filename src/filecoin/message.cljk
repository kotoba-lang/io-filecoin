  "A Filecoin message: its CBOR bytes, its CID, and the bytes a signature
  covers.

  The serialisation is a **10-element definite-length CBOR array**, in
  declaration order — not a map. `cbor-gen` emits `lengthBufMessage` = `0x8a`
  and then the fields:

      [version to from nonce value gas-limit gas-fee-cap gas-premium
       method params]

  where `to`/`from` are byte strings (protocol byte ++ payload), the three
  token amounts are `go-state-types/big` byte strings, `gas-limit` is a
  *signed* integer and everything else unsigned, and `params` is a byte
  string.

  Field order is the whole of the format. There is no key to correct a
  mistake with, so a message serialised with `value` and `gas-limit`
  transposed is not an invalid message — it is a valid message that sends a
  different amount.

  What gets signed, precisely:

      cbor        = (encode msg)
      cid-bytes   = the binary CIDv1 of that, dag-cbor + BLAKE2b-256
      secp256k1:  ECDSA over BLAKE2b-256(cid-bytes)   ← hashed *again*
      BLS:        the signature covers cid-bytes directly

  `signing-bytes` returns `cid-bytes`. The extra BLAKE2b-256 in the
  secp256k1 case belongs to the signer, and `digest-for-secp256k1` is here
  for signers that want it applied for them.

  **This does not extend to the delegated (FEVM) signature type.** A type-3
  signature covers the RLP-encoded Ethereum transaction, not this CID —
  see `filecoin.signature`. `signing-bytes` is for types 1 and 2 only."

  unconditionally rather than inferring from a key that a map has already
  been through it — an inference that gets it wrong for exactly the raw map
