(ns filecoin.bigint
  "Filecoin token amounts, on two runtimes that cannot hold them.

  A `Value` on the chain is attoFIL: 10^18 to the FIL. The total supply is
  2 × 10^27 attoFIL, which is past 2^53 by nine orders of magnitude, so a
  JavaScript `Number` cannot carry a balance — not approximately, at all.
  Amounts therefore travel through this library as **decimal strings**, and
  the platform's arbitrary-precision integer is used only inside this
  namespace (`BigInteger` on :clj, `BigInt` on :cljs).

  The wire form is `go-state-types/big`: a byte string that is *empty* for
  zero, and otherwise a sign byte (0 positive, 1 negative) followed by the
  big-endian magnitude. Note that this is a sign-magnitude encoding — not
  two's complement — so it is not the JVM's `BigInteger.toByteArray` and not
  JavaScript's `BigInt.asUintN`; both need adjusting, which is most of what
  this file does.

  Arithmetic lives here too, for the same reason the conversions do: this is
  the only namespace allowed to touch a platform big-integer, so anything
  that has to multiply a base fee by a gas delta comes through it rather than
  growing a second copy.")

  This is not a detail. Both platforms divide by truncating toward zero
  (`BigInteger.divide`; JavaScript's `/` on a BigInt) and Go's `Div` does not,
  so a direct translation is off by one for every negative numerator. The gas
  formula in `filecoin.node.basefee` divides a negative product by a positive
  constant on every block where the network is under target — which is most of
  them — and truncating there makes the fee drift upward one attoFIL at a time.
