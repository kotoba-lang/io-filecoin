(ns filecoin.address
  "Filecoin addresses — `f0` `f1` `f2` `f3` `f4`, and their `t…` testnet forms.

  An address here is a map, not a string:

      {:protocol 1 :payload [ints…] :network :mainnet}

  `:payload` is a vector of 0..255 ints so that two addresses parsed on two
  runtimes compare with `=`. A byte-array would not, and an address is a map
  key often enough for that to matter.

  The string form is *not* a serialisation of the bytes — it is a different
  encoding with a checksum in it that the byte form does not carry. Both
  directions are here:

      (from-string \"f1xtwapqc6nh4si2hcwpr3656iotzmlwumogqbuaa\")
      (to-string addr)                 ; back, with the same network prefix
      (to-bytes addr)                  ; protocol byte ++ payload — what CBOR carries
      (from-bytes bs)

  Constructors take key material:

      (secp256k1 uncompressed-pubkey)  ; f1 — blake2b-160 of 65 bytes
      (actor data)                     ; f2 — blake2b-160
      (bls pubkey-48)                  ; f3 — the key itself
      (id 1234)                        ; f0
      (delegated 10 eth-20-bytes)      ; f4 — the FEVM namespace
      (from-eth-address \"0xff00…\")     ; the same thing, spelled the way EVM
                                       ; tooling spells it

  Encoding rules are `filecoin-project/go-address`: base32 over the lowercase
  RFC 4648 alphabet with no padding, and a 4-byte BLAKE2b checksum over
  (protocol byte ++ payload). `f0` carries no checksum at all — its string
  form is a decimal number, which is why a typo in an `f0` address is
  undetectable and a typo in every other kind is not."
