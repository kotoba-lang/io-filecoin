  "Signatures and signed messages.

  A signature on the wire is **one byte string**, not a pair: the type byte
  followed by the signature data. `crypto.Signature.MarshalCBOR` writes
  `len(Data)+1` and then those bytes, so a decoder that forgets the type
  byte reads a 66-byte secp256k1 signature as a 65-byte one shifted by one —
  which verifies against nothing and looks like a bad key.

  A signed message is a 2-element CBOR array `[message signature]`.

  Its CID depends on the signature type, and this is not an optimisation:

  - **BLS** — the CID *is* the message CID. BLS signatures are aggregated
    into the block header, so the signed wrapper is not what gets stored.
  - **secp256k1** and **delegated** — the CID is that of the signed message
    itself.

  Getting this backwards means looking up a message by a CID the chain does
  not have, which presents as \"the message vanished\" rather than as an
  encoding bug.

  ## What each type actually signs — and delegated is the odd one

  The CID rule above is about *naming*. What the signature covers is a
  separate question, and the three answers are not variations of one rule:

  | type | the signature covers |
  |---|---|
  | BLS (2) | the binary message CID, directly |
  | secp256k1 (1) | BLAKE2b-256 **of** the binary message CID |
  | delegated (3) | **the RLP-encoded unsigned Ethereum transaction**, hashed with keccak-256 |

  A delegated signature does **not** cover the message CID in any form.
  Lotus's `AuthenticateMessage` reconstructs an `EthTransaction` from the
  Filecoin message, requires the round-trip back to be byte-identical, and
  then verifies the signature against the RLP encoding of that transaction —
  recovering the public key and checking that `f410f` ‖ keccak256(pubkey)[12:]
  is the sender. So the digest is the Ethereum one; the Filecoin message is
  only a re-encoding of it.

  `filecoin.message/signing-bytes` is therefore correct for types 1 and 2 and
  **wrong for type 3**, and there is no function here that produces the
  delegated payload — RLP and keccak-256 are both absent (see the README).
  Verifying, decoding and naming a delegated message all work; signing a new
  one does not."
